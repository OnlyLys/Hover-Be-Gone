> **THIS EXTENSION HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED AND UNPUBLISHED FROM THE VSCODE MARKETPLACE.**

# ~~Hover Be Gone~~

~~This extension seeks to solve a source of annoyance in vscode where the 
autosuggest and parameter-hints tooltips close one-by-one instead of all being 
closed at once when `Esc` is pressed.~~

~~With this extension, those suggestion tooltips should all close in one `Esc` 
keypress.~~
